QUESTION 1:
FIRST THING: I learned that the create call will start a new process, but you must be very specific with what data you try to pass to to the new pprocess for mthe parent process.
SECOND THING:  I learned a bit on how to implament semiphores, I am stil in the dark on how they actuallly operate, but I understand a few of the mechanism of how they communicate wiht processes.

QUESTION 2:
I made a mistake in how to check the status of the countdown status in the parent process. I had to create a way to theck the output of each decremendation.

I also tried to use the produce, consumer process model to complete to pulling impelementation which was bad. I then tried to create a single countdown process function to deal with the multiple processes.

QUESTION 3:
I would try to of developed a better conceptual plan of attack to really understand the system instead of just experamenting with the code given in the assignent until I understood what code performed what function.
